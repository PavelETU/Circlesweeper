# Circlesweeper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PavelETU/Circlesweeper.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/PavelETU/Circlesweeper)

This is the variation of the classic Minesweeper game. In order to open the field of the game you have to bomb circles 
with same colors (hello candy crash) and mark circles instead of squares.
You will be the winner as soon as you mark all mines properly and bomb all circles with the same color

This is my first game on which I worked long time ago and currently refactoring using TDD with unit tests and 
MVVM architecture with LiveData and ViewModel from Android Jetpack

During refactoring I was inspired by Robert C Martin amazing book "Clean Code". Hopefully you can notice that fact in the code

For last stable version check out master branch
