# Circlesweeper

This is the variation of the classic Minesweeper game. In order to open the field of the game you have to bomb circles 
with same colors (hello candy crash!) and mark circles instead of squares.
You will be the winner as soon as you mark all mines properly and bomb all circles with the same color

This is my first game which I worked on long time ago and currently refactoring using TDD with unit tests for ViewModel.

For working version check out master branch
